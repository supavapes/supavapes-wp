== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What does this plugin do ? = 
This plugin provides the ability to add the like and dislike buttons for WordPress native comments.

= I have enabled the plugin but like and dislike icons are not being displayed. What may be the reason ? =
Our plugin uses comment_text filter to append like and dislike icons . So if your active theme's comments template doesn't use comment_text filter to display comments text then our plugin won't be able to display like and dislike icons.

= Is there any hooks available to extend the plugin ? = 
Our plugin does contains many actions and filters which are described inside the Help Section

= Is there a way to disable fontawesome and use my own icon? = 
Yes you can disable the fontawesome from loading as well enabling "Disable Font Awesome" option in the display settings. And also we have the option to upload the custom icons where you can upload and use your own icon

= Can I undo like or dislike action =
Yes you can undo like or dislike by simply clicking again the same icon. You can also choose a color for already liked or disliked icon
